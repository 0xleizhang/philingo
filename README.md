## 📖 About

Philingo is named in honor of **Phil**, an inspiring English teacher whose text-based teaching method sparked the creation of this platform. The project evolved from a simple vocabulary lookup tool into a comprehensive language learning platform with AI-powered features.

### The Story

Growing up learning Chinese through reading and recitation, the same approach was brought to English learning by Phil. However, the tedious process of manually looking up words in a dictionary while reading interrupted the learning flow. Philingo was created to solve this problem—providing instant vocabulary help without breaking concentration.

What started as a personal tool has grown to include:
- Pronunciation practice with AI feedback
- Writing exercises for active recall
- Custom text generation for personalized learning
- Comprehensive progress tracking

### Future Plans
- 🌏 Multi-language support (starting with Chinese learning for English speakers)
- 🏫 Educational institution features
- 📱 Mobile apps
- 🎯 Gamification and learning streaks
- 👥 Social learning features
